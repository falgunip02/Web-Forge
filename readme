.promise()   :=>

//In simpler terms, .promise() is like a special function you can use with AWS SDK methods that helps you wait for an action to finish before moving on to the next step in your code.

When you call an AWS SDK method, it starts doing something in the background, like uploading a file to Amazon S3. Instead of waiting for that action to finish, the SDK gives you a special object called a "request object."

To make your code simpler and easier to understand, you can use .promise() after your AWS SDK method. This turns the "request object" into a promise, which is like a promise that something will happen in the future. You can then use await to wait for the action to finish before continuing with your code.

So, .promise() is just a helpful tool that makes it easier to work with AWS SDK methods when you're writing asynchronous code.
